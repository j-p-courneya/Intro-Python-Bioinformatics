Up until now we have been using a Jupyter Notebook to get to grips with the basic
use of Python. From now on, we will be focusing on saving our code in to scripts and running them
from the shell by executing the `python` program with our script as an argument. 

> ## Switching to Shell Commands
>
> For the majority of this lesson onwards we will be switching from typing Python commands in a Jupyter Notebook
> or a file to typing 
> commands in a shell terminal window (such as bash). When you see a `$` in front of a
> command that tells you to run that command in the shell rather than the Python interpreter.

## Writing Your First Script

A script in python is almost exactly the same as a R script you've already met, i.e. it is a
plain text file that contains lines of Python code that will be executed one after another.

To create and edit a Python script, it is almost essential to use a text editor with syntax
highlighting. For this course, we recommend using VSCode as provided by Microsoft. It's easily
installed on Windows either directly or through Anaconda
and macOS users can install and run it through Anaconda as well.

> ## Choosing a Good Text Editor
>
> When we write Python scripts, it is essential that it is written in **plain** text - this means
> you can't use a Word Processor program like MS Word as it will add quite a bit of other information
> to the created file that Python won't understand. 
> You also want to use an editor that knows about the programming language
> you're using as then it can highlight different parts of the code, help with formatting and
> show any syntax errors. There are many options out there but possible ones are:
> * Visual Studio Code
> * Spyder
> * Notepad++
> * PyCharm
> * Emacs
> * Vim

To write our first script then, start up your text editor, 
select 'New File' and create a new file called
`~/Desktop/post-docs-python/hello.py`. After this has been created and opened, type the following
and save it:
~~~
print("Hello amazing Post-Docs!")
~~~
{: .language-python}

As you can see, we have used the `.py` extension as this makes it easier to identify Python scripts
from other file types.

From your shell prompt that you were running IPython in, make sure you
are in the correct folder:
~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop/post-docs-python/
~~~
{: .language-shell}

and then type:
~~~
$ python hello.py
~~~
{: .language-shell}

Hopefully you should see what you would expect:

~~~
Hello amazing Post-Docs!
~~~
{: .output}

Congratulations! You've created your first Python script! Going forward in this course, we
recommend writing the code in scripts and executing from the shell prompt just like
this. You can continue
to use a Jupyter Notebook if you'd prefer but as things increase in complexity, it will
become harder to avoid typing errors, etc.

## Documenting your Code

Now we are starting to store code, we must start documenting it as well. This is critical, not only
for other users of your code but also yourself who may come back to some code at a later date and
not easily remember what it did or how. This is where comments become essential --- these are bits of
human readable text, denoted by `#`, that Python will ignore but can be used to explain the meaning behind certain
bits of code. Try changing the your `hello.py` file to the following:

~~~
# A simple test to check everything's working
print("Hello amazing Post-Docs!")
~~~
{: .language-python}

If you run this, you will see the same as before but now you've added some information about what
you were trying to achieve!

> ## It's not all About Comments
> 
> You shouldn't use comments as an excuse for poor variable names or code structure/formatting. 
> Your code should be fairly readable without comments. They should help with clarifications
> and overall aims of a particular piece of code.
