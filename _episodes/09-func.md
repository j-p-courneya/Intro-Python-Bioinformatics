As we've already said when looking at loops, reusing code is a very important part of good code
development and will save you a lot of pain in the long term! We've already seen how we can
use code that other people have written but what if we want to use our own code again,
on a different dataset or at a different point in our program?
Cutting and pasting it is going to make our code get very long and very repetitive,
very quickly.
We'd like a way to package our code so that it is easier to reuse,
and Python provides for this by letting us define our own 'functions' ---
a shorthand way of re-executing longer pieces of code.
Let's start by defining a function `fahr_to_celsius` that converts temperatures
from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

~~~
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
~~~
{: .language-python}

![The Blueprint for a Python Function](../fig/python-function.svg)

<!--- see https://gist.github.com/wd15/2b4ffbe5ce0d0ddb8a5b to
regenerate the above figure --->

The function definition opens with the keyword `def` followed by the
name of the function (`fahr_to_celsius`) and a parenthesized list of parameter names (`temp`). The
[body]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-body) of the function --- the
statements that are executed when it runs --- is indented below the
definition line.  The body concludes with a `return` keyword followed by the return value.

When we call the function,
the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables
so that we can use them inside the function.
Inside the function,
we use a [return statement]({{ page.root }}/reference/#return-statement) to send a result
back to whoever asked for it.

Let's try running our function.

~~~
fahr_to_celsius(32)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This command should call our function, using "32" as the input and return the function value.

In fact, calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:
~~~
print('freezing point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(212), 'C')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
freezing point of water: 0.0 C
boiling point of water: 100.0 C
~~~
{: .output}

We've successfully called the function that we defined,
and we have access to the value that we returned.


## Composing Functions

Now that we've seen how to turn Fahrenheit into Celsius,
we can also write the function to turn Celsius into Kelvin:

~~~
def celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c):
    return temp_c + 273.15

print('freezing point of water in Kelvin:', celsius_to_kelvin(0.))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
freezing point of water in Kelvin: 273.15
~~~
{: .output}

What about converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin?
We could write out the formula,
but we don't need to.
Instead,
we can [compose]({{ page.root }}/reference/#compose) the two functions we have already created:

~~~
def fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f):
    temp_c = fahr_to_celsius(temp_f)
    temp_k = celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c)
    return temp_k

print('boiling point of water in Kelvin:', fahr_to_kelvin(212.0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
boiling point of water in Kelvin: 373.15
~~~
{: .output}

This is our first taste of how larger programs are built:
we define basic operations,
then combine them in ever-large chunks to get the effect we want.
Real-life functions will usually be larger than the ones shown here --- typically half a dozen
to a few dozen lines --- but they shouldn't ever be much longer than that,
or the next person who reads it won't be able to understand what's going on.

## Defining Defaults

We have seen how to pass arguments to a function. If you don't pass these arguments, Python will
complain:

~~~
print(fahr_to_kelvin())
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-11-d31ad434dbd6> in <module>()
----> 1 fahr_to_kelvin()

TypeError: fahr_to_kelvin() missing 1 required positional argument: 'temp_f'
~~~
{: .error}

However, there are many times where we may not want to give a particular argument or have the
function provide a default value. For example, let's say we write an expanded `print` function that
will prepend anything that is printed by a label or message if requested. The majority of the time
we want it to be a particular label but in some cases the code that calls the function 
might want or need to change it. To avoid all calls to the
function having to remember to include the same label, we can set the default instead:

~~~
def label_print( msg, label_str = ">>> " ):
    print(label_str, msg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

When calling this function we can now choose whether to leave out the defaulted argument or change it:

~~~
label_print("test1")
label_print("test2", "$$$ ")
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
>>> test1
$$$ test2
~~~
{: .output}

This is handy:
if we usually want a function to work one way,
but occasionally need it to do something else,
we can allow people to pass a parameter when they need to
but provide a default to make the normal case easier.
The example below shows how Python matches values to parameters:

~~~
def display(a=1, b=2, c=3):
    print('a:', a, 'b:', b, 'c:', c)

print('no parameters:')
display()
print('one parameter:')
display(55)
print('two parameters:')
display(55, 66)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
no parameters:
a: 1 b: 2 c: 3
one parameter:
a: 55 b: 2 c: 3
two parameters:
a: 55 b: 66 c: 3
~~~
{: .output}

As this example shows,
parameters are matched up from left to right,
and any that haven't been given a value explicitly get their default value.
We can override this behavior by naming the value as we pass it in:

~~~
print('only setting the value of c')
display(c=77)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
only setting the value of c
a: 1 b: 2 c: 77
~~~
{: .output}

## Readable functions

Consider these two functions:

~~~
def s(p):
    a = 0
    for v in p:
        a += v
    m = a / len(p)
    d = 0
    for v in p:
        d += (v - m) * (v - m)
    return numpy.sqrt(d / (len(p) - 1))

def std_dev(sample):
    sample_sum = 0
    for value in sample:
        sample_sum += value

    sample_mean = sample_sum / len(sample)

    sum_squared_devs = 0
    for value in sample:
        sum_squared_devs += (value - sample_mean) * (value - sample_mean)

    return numpy.sqrt(sum_squared_devs / (len(sample) - 1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

The functions `s` and `std_dev` are computationally equivalent (they
both calculate the sample standard deviation), but to a human reader,
they look very different. You probably found `std_dev` much easier to
read and understand than `s`.

As this example illustrates, both documentation and a programmer's
_coding style_ combine to determine how easy it is for others to read
and understand the programmer's code. Choosing meaningful variable
names and using blank spaces to break the code into logical "chunks"
are helpful techniques for producing _readable code_. This is useful
not only for sharing code with others, but also for the original
programmer. If you need to revisit code that you wrote months ago and
haven't thought about since then, you will appreciate the value of
readable code!

>
> Note that `return` and `print` are not interchangeable.
> `print` is a Python function that *prints* data to the screen.
> It enables us, *users*, see the data.
> `return` statement, on the other hand, makes data visible to the program.

> **Question**: What will we see if we execute the following commands?
> ~~~
> A = add(7, 3)
> print(A)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> > ## Solution
> > Python will first execute the function `add` with `a = 7` and `b = 3`,
> > and, therefore, print `10`. However, because function `add` does not have a
> > line that starts with `return` (no `return` "statement"), it will, by default, return
> > nothing which, in Python world, is called `None`. Therefore, `A` will be assigned to `None`
> > and the last line (`print(A)`) will print `None`. As a result, we will see:

>     b = temp

> ~~~
> {: .language-python}

> Which of the following would be printed if you were to run this code?
> Why did you pick this answer?

> 1. `7 3`
> 2. `3 7`
> 3. `3 3`
> 4. `7 7`
>
> > ## Solution
> > `3, 7` is correct. Initially `a` has a value of 3 and `b` has a value of 7.
> > When the swap function is called, it creates local variables (also called
> > `a` and `b` in this case) and trades their values. The function does not
> > return any values and does not alter `a` or `b` outside of its local copy.
