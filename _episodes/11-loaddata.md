In this lesson we will take what we've learned about Python and start applying it to our arthritis
inflammation data by loading some data in and performing the first bits of analysis.

For this part, we would recommend switching back to Jupyter Notebooks while you're still exploring
the datasets as it will print out the **large** tables of data in a sensible way!

## Loading data into Python

In order to load our inflammation data, we are going to use a library called
[NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/ "NumPy Documentation"). This module contains many
numerical routines for data analysis and we will only be scratching the surface of what it can do
in this course --- it is well worth having a look to see what else is there!

> ## Load in the data
>
> The arthritis data is recorded in comma-separated list files 
> To load this, use the function `loadtxt` provided by `numpy` using the `fname`
> argument for the filename `inflammation-01.csv` and `delimiter` argument set as `,`. 
> Assign this to a variable and the `print` the variable to see what has been loaded.
> 
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > import numpy
> > data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
> > print(data)
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

You should hopefully have found the output looking like this:

~~~
array([[ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  3.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  2., ...,  1.,  0.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  2.,  1.,  1.],
       ...,
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  2.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  0.]])
~~~
{: .output}

The `loadtxt` function has loaded all the data from the `inflammation-01.csv` file and stored it
in an object. By default,
only a few rows and columns are shown
(with `...` to omit elements when displaying big arrays).
To save space,
Python displays numbers as `1.` instead of `1.0`
when there's nothing interesting after the decimal point.

This object looks a bit like a list of lists (note the square brackets!) but let's check 
exactly what it is by using the `type` function:

~~~
print(type(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to
an N-dimensional array, the functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library.
These arrays are similar to lists but you can do a lot more with them and they are
used throughout the numpy library.
These data correspond to arthritis patients' inflammation.
The rows are the individual patients, and the columns
are their daily inflammation measurements.

> ## Data Type and Shape
> 
> When we created the variable `data` to store our arthritis data, we didn't just create the 
> array; we also created information about the array, called 
> [members]({{ page.root }}/reference/#member) or attributes. These members are accessed just
> like functions on an object or from a module using the `.` operator.
>
> Use the `dtype` and `shape` members of your `data` variable to find out what the array contains
> and how many rows and columns it has.
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > print(data.dtype)
> > print(data.shape)
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

This should have told you that the array contains `float64` or floating point numbers and
has 60 rows and 40 columns. 

If we want to get a single number from the array, we must provide an
[index]({{ page.root }}/reference/#index) in square brackets after the variable name, just as we
do in math when referring to an element of a matrix and how we accessed elements in strings and
lists. However, our inflammation data has two dimensions, so
we will need to use two indices to refer to one specific value. Here is where NumPy arrays differ
significantly from normal lists in that you can give both indices in the square brackets:

~~~
print('first value in data:', data[0, 0])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first value in data: 0.0
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('middle value in data:', data[30, 20])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
middle value in data: 13.0
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `data[30, 20]` accesses the element at row 30, column 20. As with lists, NumPy arrays
are zero-indexed and so start from (0,0).

> ## In the Corner
>
> What may also surprise you is that when Python displays an array,
> it shows the element with index `[0, 0]` in the upper left corner
> rather than the lower left.
> This is consistent with the way mathematicians draw matrices
> but different from the Cartesian coordinates.
> The indices are (row, column) instead of (column, row) for the same reason,
> which can be confusing when plotting data.
> ![Zero Index](../fig/python-zero-index.png)
{: .callout}

Arrays also know how to perform common mathematical operations on their values.  The simplest
operations with data are arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  When you
do such operations on arrays, the operation is done element-by-element.  Thus:

~~~
doubledata = data * 2.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

will create a new array `doubledata`
each elements of which is twice the value of the corresponding element in `data`:

~~~
print('original:')
print(data[:3, 36:])
print('doubledata:')
print(doubledata[:3, 36:])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
original:
[[ 2.  3.  0.  0.]
 [ 1.  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 2.  2.  1.  1.]]
doubledata:
[[ 4.  6.  0.  0.]
 [ 2.  2.  0.  2.]
 [ 4.  4.  2.  2.]]
~~~
{: .output}

If, instead of taking an array and doing arithmetic with a single value (as above), you did the
arithmetic operation with another array of the same shape, the operation will be done on
corresponding elements of the two arrays.  Thus:

~~~
tripledata = doubledata + data
~~~
{: .language-python}

will give you an array where `tripledata[0,0]` will equal `doubledata[0,0]` plus `data[0,0]`,
and so on for all other elements of the arrays.

~~~
print('tripledata:')
print(tripledata[:3, 36:])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
tripledata:
[[ 6.  9.  0.  0.]
 [ 3.  3.  0.  3.]
 [ 6.  6.  3.  3.]]
~~~
{: .output}

Often, we want to do more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide array elements.  NumPy knows how
to do more complex operations, too.  If we want to find the average inflammation for all patients on
all days, for example, we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
6.14875
~~~
{: .output}

`mean` is a [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) that takes
an array as an [argument]({{ page.root }}/reference/#argument).

> ## Mean Value for a subset of data
> 
> Can you use what you know about slicing to calculate the mean value for a single patient (row)
> and column (day)?
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > # Single patient mean
> > print(numpy.mean(data[0,:]))
> > # Single day mean
> > print(numpy.mean(data[:,0]))
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

NumPy has lots of useful functions that take an array as input.
Let's use three of those functions to get some descriptive values about the dataset.
We'll also use multiple assignment,
a convenient Python feature that will enable us to do this all in one line.

~~~
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.max(data), numpy.min(data), numpy.std(data)

print('maximum inflammation:', maxval)
print('minimum inflammation:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here we've assigned the return value from `numpy.max(data)` to the variable `maxval`, the value
from `numpy.min(data)` to `minval`, and so on.

~~~
maximum inflammation: 20.0
minimum inflammation: 0.0
standard deviation: 4.61383319712
~~~
{: .output}

When analyzing data, though,
we often want to look at variations in statistical values,
such as the maximum inflammation per patient (as in the
next diagram on the left)
or the average inflammation per day  (as in the
diagram on the right).  As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the
operation across an axis:

![Operations Across Axes](../fig/python-operations-across-axes.png)

To support this functionality,
most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example),
we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[  0.           0.45         1.11666667   1.75         2.43333333   3.15

   8.35         7.73333333   8.36666667   9.5          9.58333333

  11.03333333  10.16666667  10.           8.66666667   9.15         7.25
   7.33333333   6.58333333   6.06666667   5.95         5.11666667   3.6

   0.56666667]
~~~
{: .output}

 As a quick check,
we can ask this array what its shape is:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(40,)
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `(40,)` tells us we have an N×1 vector,
So each entry is the average inflammation over all patients for that day
and there is a single entry per day.
If we average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example), we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[ 5.45   5.425  6.1    5.9    5.55   6.225  5.975  6.65   6.625  6.525
