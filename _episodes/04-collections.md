We have learnt how to store single bits of data in variables but what happens when we have several
bits of data that are associated with each other and need to be stored together? For example, 
a vector, array or list of names? For this we can use the built-in collection types of `list`
and `dict` (short for dictionary).

## Storing Multiple Values in a List

We create a list by putting values inside square brackets and separating the values with commas:

~~~
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
print('odds are:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
odds are: [1, 3, 5, 7]
~~~
{: .output}

We select individual elements from lists by indexing them just as we did for strings:

~~~
print('first and third:', odds[0], odds[2])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first and third: 1 5
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Starting From Zero
>
> It's very important to remember that Python (like many other languages) indexes it's collections
> from zero rather than one. In other words, the first element of list is given by index `0`, the
> second by index `1`, etc. Therefore the last element is given by the number of elements in the
> list minus one, e.g. for the example above, the last element is `odds[3]`.
> 
> Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1
> because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
> Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
> because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
> value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
> that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
> reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
> [Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
{: .callout}

You can use negative indices to access elements from the end of the list as well, so the last
element would be `-1`, the penultimate `-2`, etc.:

~~~
print('first and last:', odds[0], odds[-1])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first and last: 1 7
~~~
{: .output}

You may have noticed there is a significant similarity between lists and strings and
in fact a lot of the things you can do with strings you can also do with lists. However, 
there is one important difference between the two: we can change the values in a list,
but we cannot change individual characters in a string.
For example:

~~~
names = ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']  # typo in Darwin's name
print('names is originally:', names)
names[1] = 'Darwin'  # correct the name
print('final value of names:', names)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
names is originally: ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']
final value of names: ['Curie', 'Darwin', 'Turing']
~~~
{: .output}

works, but:

~~~
name = 'Darwin'
name[0] = 'd'
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~

There are many ways to change the contents of lists besides assigning new values to individual elements:

~~~
odds.append(11)
print('odds after adding a value:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
odds after adding a value: [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
del odds[0]
print('odds after removing the first element:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
odds after removing the first element: [3, 5, 7, 11]
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
odds.reverse()
print('odds after reversing:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
odds after reversing: [11, 7, 5, 3]
~~~
{: .output}

While modifying in place, it is useful to remember that Python treats lists in a slightly
counter-intuitive way.

If we make a list and (attempt to) copy it then modify in place, we can cause all sorts of trouble:

~~~
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
primes = odds
primes.append(2)
print('primes:', primes)
print('odds:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
primes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
odds: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
~~~
{: .output}

This is because Python stores a list in memory, and then can use multiple variables names
(or 'labels') to refer to the
same list. If all we want to do is copy a (simple) list, we can use the `list` function, so we do
not modify a list we did not mean to:

~~~
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
primes = list(odds)
primes.append(2)
print('primes:', primes)
print('odds:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
primes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
odds: [1, 3, 5, 7]
~~~
{: .output}

This is different from how variables worked in lesson 2 when you were storing (immutable)
numbers and strings. By default, Python will apply another variable name to the same object
rather than copying it if it's not one of the basic immutable types.

### Slicing Lists

Subsets of lists and strings can be accessed by specifying ranges of values in the square
brackets using a colon to separate the first and last+1 index required.
This is commonly referred to as "slicing" the list/string.

~~~
binomial_name = "Drosophila melanogaster"
group = binomial_name[0:10]
print("group:", group)

species = binomial_name[11:24]
print("species:", species)

chromosomes = ["X", "Y", "2", "3", "4"]
autosomes = chromosomes[2:5]
print("autosomes:", autosomes)

last = chromosomes[-1]
print("last:", last)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
group: Drosophila
species: melanogaster
autosomes: ["2", "3", "4"]
last: 4
~~~
{: .output}

If you want to take a slice from the beginning of a sequence, you can omit the first index in the
range:

~~~
date = "Monday 4 January 2016"
day = date[0:6]
print("Using 0 to begin range:", day)
day = date[:6]
print("Omitting beginning index:", day)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Using 0 to begin range: Monday
Omitting beginning index: Monday
~~~
{: .output}

And similarly, you can omit the ending index in the range to take a slice to the very end of the
sequence:

~~~
months = ["jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"]
sond = months[8:12]
print("With known last position:", sond)
sond = months[8:len(months)]
print("Using len() to get last entry:", sond)
sond = months[8:]
print("Omitting ending index:", sond)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
With known last position: ["sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"]
Using len() to get last entry: ["sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"]
Omitting ending index: ["sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"]
~~~
{: .output}

## Using Dictionaries to Store Associative Data

Lists are used to store ordered collections of objects that you need to access with a simple
index value. However, not all data is like this. For example, how would you store data from an
address book where you have 'fields' that have values associated with them? In Python, you can
use a type of collection called a Dictionary. Values stored in a dictionary are associated with a
**key** that you can then use to retrieve the value instead of using an index:

~~~
info_dict = { "First Name" : "Fred", "Surname": "Peterson", "Age": 25 }
print( info_dict["Surname"] )
print( info_dict["Age"] )
~~~
{: .language-python}

You can use any immutable object as a key (in practise this is generally numbers or strings!) and
store any object as the value including `list`s or other `dict`s. As with lists, there are 
several ways to add entries to a dictionary. The easiest of these is to
simply reference a new key and assign it a value:

~~~
info_dict["Country"] = "UK"
print(info_dict)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
{'First Name': 'Fred', 'Surname': 'Peterson', 'Age': 25, 'Country': 'UK'}
~~~
{: .output}
