title: Filtering Data
teaching: 5
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I filter out bad data?"
objectives:
- "Using conditionals, protect your analysis code from bad data"
keypoints:
- "If you can identify attributes of bad data in your dataset, you can get your program to filter them out"

In our last lesson, we discovered something suspicious was going on
in our inflammation data by drawing some plots. Using our new-found knowledge of conditionals,
we can get Python to automatically recognize the different features we saw,
and take a different action for each

> ## Checking the Maxima
>
> In the first couple of plots, the maximum inflammation per day
> seemed to rise like a straight line, one unit per day.
> By editing the code from the previous lesson, add a check in the `for` loop for this effect,
> e.g. that the maximum for the first day is zero and the max for 21st day is 20.
> Print out a message if a problem is found
> 
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > if numpy.max(data, axis=0)[0] == 0 and numpy.max(data, axis=0)[20] == 20:
> >     print('Suspicious looking maxima!')
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Checking the Minima
>
> We also saw a different problem in the third dataset;
> the minima per day were all zero (looks like a healthy person snuck into our study).
> Add to your code with an `elif` condition to check if all the minima in a dataset add
> up to zero. Hint: `numpy` has a `sum` function!
>
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > elif numpy.sum(numpy.min(data, axis=0)) == 0:
> >     print('Minima add up to zero!')
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Finally, if neither of these conditions are true, we can use `else` to give the all-clear:

~~~
else:
    print('Seems OK!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Run your code and you should hopefully now see messages printed identifying the different
features in the plots --- the first two with suspicious maxima and the third with suspicious
minima.
